            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
            <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
            command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
            everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
            Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
            We believe there are at <strong>least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
            learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

        <h2>Background</h2>
        
        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangarous is an outgrowth of the <a href="https://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and the <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">softcover publishing platfoorm</a>. This page is part of the sample site for <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learrn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext<strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universak language of the World Wide Web.

        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
            Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
            sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
            <em>at least a billion people</em>, and probably more.

            William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen
            lines long (three
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain">quatrains</a>
            followed by a rhyming
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>).
            <strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:

        <blockquote>
        <p>
            Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
            Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
            Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
            And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
        </p>
